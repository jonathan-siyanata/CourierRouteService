# Courier Web Application Service
This is a courier web application service that generates the shortest route using different algorithms. The application 
has the ability to use diverse algorithms which render different results. Thus far the Nearest Neighbor algorthim proved
very useful and calculated the shortest route in the shortest time as the number of routes increased, unfortunately Brute Force
could not keep up as the number of routes increased.I used Java with Spring Boot and these are the following technologies I used, for the backend:
I used Feign Client and Restful Api's. The frontend consists of the following technologies: HTML and the JQuery. I used these technologies
based on the lastest automations avaiable and their capabilities. The challenges I faced were numerous considering it was my first full web 
application project, the challenges were on both front and back end ranging from java debugging to javascript debugging.

## How To Use The Application
The application requires a driver id and password to be able to access the route creation functionality. All one has to do is select a route
asscociated with a particular driver, once the route has been choosen select the algorithm you would like to apply so the shortest route can be 
generated. When the shortest route has been generated the route will be automatically ploted on the map.

## Credits
I would like to thank the Developers at Jalia Technologies for helping me through each and every procedure I experienced and their time and knowlegde 
is sincerely appreciated, it was an amazing learning curve and my foundation has been solidified.
